### Self-Learning ChatBot

RobotFriend.py is a self-learning chatbot that uses ML and AI techniques and algorithms to save the inputs from the user and use them later. 
We train the chatbot with general data from https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus/tree/master/chatterbot_corpus/data/english and with some custom data that we manually define in the code.
